This is just a super-quick post to mention about a new section on my website, "Ideas".  The whole intent of this new section is to share ideas for software related projects, be-it applications, games or just techniques.  I may work on some of them, I may not, but the intention was to share ideas rather than just letting them float off into the ether, which is too easily done unfortunately.

Please check it out via the main navigation bar.  I've also spent the time tweaking some styles of this site, HTML / CSS really isn't my thing, so it may take me some attempts before things look right.
