cachy was officially released today on both the Microsoft Store and Google Play.

## Awaiting Feedback

As is the nature of these things, I have no idea if cachy is going to be popular or not, both Microsoft and Google Play stores are at an extreme saturation point so I'm really relying on people to give it a try, and hopefully at the price point that it has been positioned (Â£1.49 GBP) this will be appealing.

So if you're in need of a password manager to replace your existing system, or as you don't currently use one, please consider cachy! Head over to the store pages below to find out more.
