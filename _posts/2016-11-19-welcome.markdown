Welcome to the new home of devoctomy, a software development company that specialises in all things Windows.

After a considerable time in the dark, I have finally gotten around to getting devoctomy online.  As usual, I'm thoroughly impressed by Jekyll and love the workflow of pushing to GIT and having my changes automatically compiled by Travis-CI and then published to Amazon S3 for all to see.
