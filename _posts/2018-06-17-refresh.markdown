Welcome to the home of devoctomy, a small software development start-up based in Brighton.

## Refreshed

After a long time of being extremely snowed under with my day job, I was unable to dedicate the time necessary to this website.  Fortunately, I now believe that the tide has turned and I have some time on my hands, so I look forward to bringing some (hopefully) regular updates in the near future.

Although visible content is still thin on the ground, there is much that I hope to be sharing within the coming months.  The company itself has pivoted slightly, from solely Windows, to a more generic stand-point, including VR (Windows / Android / Linux).

I'm also hoping to release more content onto GitHub and even the Unity store (some free, some paid packages).

You can visit our GitHub organisational home, [here](https://github.com/devoctomy).  We don't have masses of useful code there at the moment, but as mentioned previously, there is plenty to come.
