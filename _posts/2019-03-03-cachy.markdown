After almost 4 years since devoctomy was founded, we are finally nearing release of our first official commercial application, cachy, the 'Cross-Platform Password Protection System'.

## A Little Background

As things have been extremely quiet regarding cachy on the devoctomy website, well, regarding anything really! I thought I had best provide a little bit of background information.

To put it as simply as possible, cachy has been in development for around a year now, and was born out of necessity for a cross-platform password protection system, similar to KeePass, but a little newer and with a nicer user experience, no disrespect meant to KeePass, as it is an invaluable tool, and we can only dream of cachy being anywhere near as popular or as widely used.

## Coming Soon!

Expect to see more information posted here in the coming weeks, along with an official home for cachy, which will be at [www.cachy.me](http://www.cachy.me).
I have lots to do, so I best get on with it!
