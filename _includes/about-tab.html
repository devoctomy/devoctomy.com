    <h2 class="preview__header">About The Website</h2>

    This website was created using an open-source Jekyll theme from <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll">Thomas Vaeth</a>.  Picked for its simple but elegant design.  You might ask that if we are a software development company, why didn't we create our own?  Well you may or may not know that the world of software development is a huge field, website development is not our forte so we would rather leave it to those that can do it best.  Plus as the code is open-source, feel free to download and play with it.
