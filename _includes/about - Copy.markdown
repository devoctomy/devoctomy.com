---
devoctomy is a software development company that specialises in all things Windows, we consist of 2; Microsoft fan boys, Nick Pateman the CEO and sole developer, and Marc McKerracher the tester in chief (so if anything doesn't work, it's his fault).  

Founded in April 2015, devoctomy plans on bringing software products for the Windows platform, primarily that of Universal Windows 10.  As life is short, and we are here to enjoy every moment of it, our software will tend to have a certain toung-in-cheek edge about it

We have an archive of potentially cool and fun products that we plan on releasing in the near future, so watch this space.

> This website was created using an open-source Jekyll theme from [Thomas Vaeth](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll).  Picked for its simple but elegant design.  You might ask that if we are a software development company, why didn't we create our own?  Well you may or may not know that the world of software development is a huge field, website development is not our forte so we would rather leave it to those that can do it best.  Plus as the code is open-source, feel free to download and play with it.
