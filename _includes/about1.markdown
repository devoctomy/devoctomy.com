## Who Are We?

Founded in February 2015, devoctomy is a software development company that specialises in all things Windows, we consist of 2; Microsoft fan boys, Nick Pateman the CEO and sole developer, and Marc McKerracher the tester in chief (so if anything doesn't work, it's his fault).

We are based on the south coast of England, near sunny ol' Brighton (Where all the cool kids go).
